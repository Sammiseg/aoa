                        <p>Hello friends! Radiant Dawn are currently OPEN for recruitment. Our pack will
                            be a safe haven for baby carnivores and our own members. We are a tight knit
                            pack and consider each other a family, are very welcoming to new people joining
                            us. We like to hold events, game and spar nights and try to keep good relations
                            with our fellow packs and herds. We are looking for recruits who like to have
                            fun, are polite and abide by ALL server rules. When wanting to apply we will
                            send you a short application and go from there. Whether you're new to the server
                            or game we will help you grow. Fighting isn't the only thing we look at with our
                            recruits. We like to keep a safe space for everyone, especially our members.

                            Hello! We are a semi-friendly group that call our little area of hunters
                            thicket/snake gully home. We ask everyone to ask permission to pass through or
                            quest before entering - if we run into anyone in territory that has not
                            announced themselves then we will be quick to defend. We may hunt and defend
                            territory from anyone who was not given access but we do like to have friendly
                            visitors every once and a while and may even offer help questing there. Anyone
                            working to restore the water in HT or eating from our corpse will be KOS as we
                            like to keep that to ourselves. Any non-pack gators or sachis in territory will
                            also be KOS. Babies are always welcome as long as they announce whether it be
                            carni or herbie. Drinking from our water is always allowed in-fact it is welcome
                            - we may even offer you food if you drain our lake sufficiently.
                            <br><br>

                        <p>We are a safe territory for juvi and adol carnis to eat, drink, and grow so long as they respect AoA and pack rules. The territory is enter/eat/drink at your own risk for sub adult+ carnis and all herbis. Non members may not hunt in territory nor may they KOS others in territory. 
<br><br>
                            Territory members reserve the right to KOS at their discretion, and/or hunger reasons. Make sure you announce yourself when you enter territory! Whether you’re a juvi carni, adult carni, or herbi, you must announce yourself in local (or global if herbi) when you’ve come to GV territory or you will be eaten for dinner!
                            <br><br>
                            Dinos that overstay their welcome are also subject to being dinner! Just a reminder our water refill area is KOS! If we catch people doing the quest, or too near the refill area we will KOS without hesitation!

We are always willing to test our skills and luck out in the hotspots such as Grand plains or Impact crater honing our fighting skills for survival
Carnivores Please Announce in global if you plan to come through territory, we reserve the right to KOS in our territory after a warning. We will not tolerate anyone hunting in our boundaries, we will defend it from invaders and or if you’re Feeling feisty? Announce that you're near our territory seeking a duel Otherwise, let us know if you would like to pass through, we come not to vanquish our enemies, but to foster friendships, as you enter our domain, you may be caught up in our fun and games. Perhaps you will find a home amongst our Herd.

                        We may look tasty, but snack at your own risk! This herd makes a point to locate any herbis in distress and escort them to safety, taking down any carnis that try for a nibble. We pride ourselves in maintaining good vibes and do what we can to help each other. Our home of Titan Pass/Birchwoods is aimed to be a baby sanctuary where little herbis can quest and grow in peace. All carnis are advised to go around the sanctuary or pay the ultimate price of being KOS'd.
