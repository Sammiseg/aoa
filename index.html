                    Ive been gaming since i can remember, been a staff on many different servers and
                    games and an owner on three. Im 25 years old and a Corrections Officer. What
                    makes being a staff worth it to me is being able to bring joy to the players and
                    create a space where people can let loose and have fun and escape their everyday
                    lives.

                    I’ve been gaming since I was very little. I’m 25 years old. I work as a Beer
                    Vendor because hey someone’s gotta keep everyone drunk 😆. What I love most
                    about being part of the staff is to be able to make a space for everyone to have
                    fun and just enjoy this game we all love to play!

                    have a husband and 4 pups which you will see pictures of often. I can often be
                    found around Triad or the surrounding area since my dinos have called that home
                    for a while now. I'm a big fan of ceratopsians, hadrosaurs and the duck. I'm
                    looking forward to providing an environment where people feel heard and
                    respected💜 <br> DM's are open as long as you remain respectful in there.

                    Hey y’all I’m Angel - Famine, on AoA you’ll almost always find me just hanging
                    around or raising some babies 💚 I swap a lot between Carni or Herbi, so if you
                    ever want someone to quest/grow off of I’m always willing help out! IRL you’ll
                    find me on horseback or on the lake in the summer, or bundled up with a book and
                    my dogs in the winter. I’ve worked in the medical field for several years now,
                    and I like to stay pretty busy in general. If you ever have any questions or
                    need some help with anything feel free to reach out!

                    the time as well as what my friends want to play. I love playing video games and
                    just hanging out with others while we all play other games or the same game.
                    Just getting into D&D as well as anime, so far my favorite show is Demon Slayer.
