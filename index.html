        enjoy a scary theme? Do you love some rules, do you not like mix packing
        of diets? How about a friendly group of people wanting to help you out
        when they can? Then this server is for you! Let me introduce you to the

            Ive been gaming since i can remember, been a staff on many different
            servers and games and an owner on three. Im 25 years old and a
            Corrections Officer. What makes being a staff worth it to me is
            being able to bring joy to the players and create a space where
            people can let loose and have fun and escape their everyday lives.

            Iâ€™ve been gaming since I was very little. Iâ€™m 25 years old. I work
            as a Beer Vendor because hey someoneâ€™s gotta keep everyone drunk ðŸ˜†.
            What I love most about being part of the staff is to be able to make
            a space for everyone to have fun and just enjoy this game we all
            love to play!

          About me: This is an ancient picture since I guess I don't take
          selfies without my husband for whatever reason. I'm just your socially
          awkward, herbie main who loves duckin around. I have a husband and 4
          pups which you will see often, sorry not sorry. I'm looking forward to
          providing an environment where people feel heard and respectedðŸ’œ

          Hey yâ€™all Iâ€™m Angel - Famine, on AoA youâ€™ll almost always find me just
          hanging around or raising some babies ðŸ’š I swap a lot between Carni or
          Herbi, so if you ever want someone to quest/grow off of Iâ€™m always
          willing help out! IRL youâ€™ll find me on horseback or on the lake in
          the summer, or bundled up with a book and my dogs in the winter. Iâ€™ve
          worked in the medical field for several years now, and I like to stay
          pretty busy in general. If you ever have any questions or need some
          help with anything feel free to reach out!

          Hey there everyone names FreeBird - General of Conquest. I'm the Lead Mod over at AoA and will exclusively find me over there. I play all types of dinos depending on what the pop is at the time as well as what my friends want to play. I love playing video games and just hanging out with others while we all play other games or the same game. Just getting into D&D as well as anime, so far my favorite show is Demon Slayer.
          <br>
          I am always open to DM's for any questions so feel free to reach out at anytime. ðŸ’œ

          80-100 words per minute typing speed, there is no escape from my
          reminders to stretch, drink water, and be kind to yourself and others.
          Helping people and the environment are my biggest joys in life. If
          you're smiling, I am too. I promise to do my best as a mod!

          Hello! I am Kenketsu, but many people simply call me Ken. I'm one of AOA's mods and I generally play herbivores, but you might occassionally see me sporting some teeth every once in a while! I'm quite the busy body, but my love for all things fantasy and science means I'll probably be able to chime in on any subject if you ask! 
          <br>
          <br>
          For questions or just general conversation, I am a Discord message away!
